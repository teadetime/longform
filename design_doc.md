Design

Design Constraints
- Different than social media existing on phone
- Needs a physical component
  - Needs to be sufficiently differnet than getting a random email, I don't see a way around printing something


Problems:
- Expense
  - Receipt printer is >$50
  - Pi Zero is $15 plus powering it
  - Could an ESP32 with a printer library work?
